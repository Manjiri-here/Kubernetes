# Kubernetes

**Docker** is a platform for creating and running containers.  
**Kubernetes** (K8s) is a **container orchestration platform**.  
In simple words, Kubernetes manages and coordinates containers.

For kubernetes , comtainer is required component to run workloads, but not necessary that the container is built using dokcer only.

## üü° Why use Kubernetes instead of Docker?

Docker has some limitations that Kubernetes helps to solve:

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Single Host Limitation

- **Docker runs containers on a single host** (like one EC2 server).  
- Docker containers are **ephemeral**‚Äîthey can die or restart at any time.  
- If one container uses too much memory, it affects other containers on the same host (because of how Linux works).

**How Kubernetes solves this:**  
Kubernetes uses a **cluster** (a group of servers).  
- The cluster has **one master node** and **multiple worker nodes**.  
- If a container is using too much memory and affecting others, Kubernetes moves the affected container to a different node.  
- This stops a single faulty container from harming the rest.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ No Auto-Healing in Docker

- If a container is stopped or killed, the application inside it is **not accessible** anymore.  
- A DevOps engineer must **manually restart** the container.

**How Kubernetes solves this:**  
Kubernetes has **auto-healing**.  
- When a container goes down, the **API server** notices and tells the system to start a new container automatically.  
- No manual work needed!

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ No Auto-Scaling in Docker

- Imagine a streaming platform (like OTT) using Docker.  
- If many users join and **CPU/RAM are fully used**, you need more containers to handle the load.  
- Docker doesn‚Äôt have built-in **auto-scaling**.  
- You‚Äôd have to **manually** create new containers and set up a load balancer.

**How Kubernetes solves this:**  
Kubernetes can **auto-scale** using:  
- **ReplicaSet:** You define in a YAML file how many replicas (containers) you need.  
- **HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler):** You set rules (like ‚Äúif CPU usage is over 80%, add more containers‚Äù).  

This way, Kubernetes **automatically adds new containers** when needed.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ No Enterprise-Level Support in Docker

- Docker is **simple and minimal**, so it lacks many enterprise features.  
- Without tools like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes, Docker **does not support**:  
  - Load balancers  
  - Firewalls  
  - Auto-scaling  
  - Auto-healing  
  - API gateways  

**How Kubernetes solves this:**  
Kubernetes provides **enterprise-grade support** for these features.  
It‚Äôs always improving to meet **security** and **functionality standards**.

## üåü A Bit of History

- **Kubernetes was created at Google** when they worked on a tool called **Borg**.  
- Kubernetes has basic load balancing by default (round-robin for services).
- But for more advanced routing and load balancing, Kubernetes uses Ingress.
- Ingress is just a set of rules for how to handle incoming traffic.
- The actual work is done by Ingress Controllers (like NGINX or HAProxy) which are added by the community.Ingress itself is just the set of rules (YAML); the controller is the engine that applies them.
- That‚Äôs how Kubernetes extends its capabilities to include advanced load balancing, HTTPS termination, and routing.
