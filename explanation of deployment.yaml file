| `apiVersion: apps/v1`                      | Declares version of Kubernetes API to use                        | tells Kubernetes which version of its functionality to use for this kind of object. “apps/v1” is the stable version for Deployments. |
| `kind: Deployment`                         | Tells K8s what type of object this is                            | “Deployment” means this will manage pods for you, ensuring there are a certain number running, updating them, etc.                   |
| `metadata:`                                | Data about this object itself                                    | basic info so Kubernetes can refer to it (its name, labels about it).                                                                |
| `name: myapp-profile`                      | Name of this deployment object                                   | so you can refer to it (e.g., `kubectl get deployment myapp-profile`).                                                               |
| `labels:` under metadata                   | Labels attached to the Deployment object                         | used for organizing, querying, maybe monitoring. But these labels are about the Deployment itself, not the pods.                     |
| `spec:`                                    | The “specification” of what you want to happen                   | describes how many replicas, what pods should look like, etc. The “desired state.”                                                   |
| `replicas: 3`                              | You want 3 copies of your app running                            | so Kubernetes will try to always have 3 pods alive. If one crashes, it will spin up another.                                         |
| `selector:`                                | How Kubernetes finds the pods this Deployment should be managing | “selector” is like saying “which pods belong to me (this deployment)?”                                                               |
| `matchLabels:` under selector              | One way to define that selector via labels                       | you give key/value pairs that must match pod labels for pods to belong to this deployment.                                           |
| `app: profile` under matchLabels           | A specific key/value pair the pods must have                     | pods must have `label: app=profile` for deployment to “see” them/manage them.                                                        |
| `template:`                                | The template/blueprint for pods this Deployment will create      | this tells Kubernetes what each of the pods should look like. Think of it like a cookie cutter.                                      |
| `metadata:` inside template                | Data about pods created from this template                       | labels here, name etc., attached to pods themselves (not deployment object).                                                         |
| `labels:` under template metadata          | Labels that will be applied to those pods                        | essential: these must match what selector is expecting (matchLabels) so the deployment knows “these pods are mine.”                  |
| `app: profile` under template labels       | This gives each pod `app=profile` label                          | ensures those pods match selector, so deployment can track them.                                                                     |
| `spec:` under template                     | Details about what runs inside the pods                          | containers, images, ports, etc. Describes application container.                                                                     |
| `containers:` list                         | The actual containers that will run in the pods                  | you define what container image, what port it listens etc.                                                                           |
| `- name: myapp-profile_containers`         | The name you assign to that container inside the pod             | so logs / commands / metrics can refer to it.                                                                                        |
| `image: manjirinaik/docker-image-1:latest` | Which Docker image to use for that container                     | that’s the code + dependencies for your app.                                                                                         |
| `ports:` / `containerPort: 8000`           | Which port the container listens on inside the pod               | Kubernetes uses this for networking, so Services or probes know where to send traffic.                                               |


Selector + matchLabels act like a “filter” that Deployment uses to track which pods belong to it. If pods don’t match those labels, the Deployment will ignore them. (It won’t manage them.) 

The labels in the pod template (template.metadata.labels) must include the same key/value pairs that the selector requires. Otherwise, the Deployment won’t recognize its own pods. Kubernetes will either throw error or just won’t match them. 

Simple Analogy-

Think of a Deployment like a manager of a team:

The Deployment is the manager role (object).

The selector / matchLabels is like the manager saying: “I manage anyone who wears badge ‘team: profile’.”

The pod template with labels is how new team members are hired with that badge. They must have badge “team=profile” so the manager knows they are part of the team.

Replicas = 3 means manager wants to always have 3 team members. If someone leaves (pod dies), manager hires (spawns) another with the same badge.
